Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, 
such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because 
such functions have ceased (they have died) or because they never had such functions and 
are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, 
and bacteria. Biology is the science that studies life.

There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life.
 One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, 
 are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, 
 respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such 
 as viruses and viroids.
